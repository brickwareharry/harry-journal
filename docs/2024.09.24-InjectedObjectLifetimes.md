# Injected Object Lifetimes: Singleton, Transient and Scoped

In .NET, objects (services) that are registered with Dependency Injection (DI) can be injected into your classes with different **lifetimes** or **service types**. These lifetimes define how often an instance of a service is created and whether it is shared across different components.

There are **three primary lifetimes** (types) for injected objects in .NET:

### 1. **Singleton**
   - **Lifetime**: A single instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application. It is created the first time it's requested and is reused for every subsequent request.
   - **Use Case**: When you need to maintain a single, shared state throughout the entire application (e.g., a configuration object, logging providers).
   - **Example**: 
     ```csharp
     services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
     ```

   - **Key Points**:
     - Created once and reused.
     - Suitable for stateful services.
     - Remains in memory until the application shuts down.

### 2. **Transient**
   - **Lifetime**: A new instance of the service is created each time it's requested. This means a fresh instance is provided every time a service is injected.
   - **Use Case**: For stateless services or services where a new, independent instance is required for every operation (e.g., lightweight services like repositories, data processing tasks).
   - **Example**:
     ```csharp
     services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
     ```

   - **Key Points**:
     - Created every time the service is requested.
     - Best for lightweight, stateless services.
     - Can lead to performance overhead if the service is complex or expensive to create.

### 3. **Scoped**
   - **Lifetime**: A new instance is created once per **scope**. In web applications, this scope typically corresponds to a single HTTP request. The same instance is used throughout that request but is different for each new request.
   - **Use Case**: When you need a service that has a consistent state for the duration of a single request (e.g., services interacting with databases during a single HTTP request).
   - **Example**:
     ```csharp
     services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
     ```

   - **Key Points**:
     - Created once per scope (usually per HTTP request in web apps).
     - Reused within that scope, but not across different scopes.
     - Suitable for services that need to maintain some state throughout a request, such as database contexts.

### Summary of the 3 Lifetimes:

| Lifetime  | Instance Creation           | Usage                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Singleton** | Created once, shared across the app | For global shared state (e.g., configuration, logging providers) |
| **Transient** | New instance each time    | For stateless, lightweight services         |
| **Scoped**    | New instance per request/operation | For services that maintain state during a single operation (e.g., database context) |

### Special Case: **IOptions<T>**
While not a direct lifetime type, services like `IOptions<T>` or `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` provide a mechanism for accessing configuration options. They have specific lifetimes as well:
- **IOptions<T>**: Singleton by default (global configuration options).
- **IOptionsSnapshot<T>**: Scoped, used for configuration that changes per request.

### How to Choose the Right Lifetime:
- **Singleton**: Use when you need a single, shared instance (e.g., caching services, application configuration, or logging providers).
- **Transient**: Use when you need fresh instances each time (e.g., lightweight, stateless services).
- **Scoped**: Use when you want services tied to a request, like handling database contexts in web apps.
