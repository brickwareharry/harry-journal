# Check user information in Linux bash shell

- **`whoami`**: Displays the username of the current user. For example, if you run `whoami`, and it outputs `harry`, it indicates that you are logged in as the user `harry`.

- **`grep harry /etc/passwd`**: Searches for the user `harry` in the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains information about all user accounts on the system. The result `harry:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/harry:/bin/bash` shows detailed user information:
  - **harry**: Username.
  - **x**: Password is stored in a separate, secure file (`/etc/shadow`).
  - **1000**: User ID (UID).
  - **1000**: Group ID (GID).
  - **/home/harry**: Home directory.
  - **/bin/bash**: Default shell (Bash).

In summary, `whoami` identifies the current user, while `grep` fetches detailed information about that user from the system's user account database.
