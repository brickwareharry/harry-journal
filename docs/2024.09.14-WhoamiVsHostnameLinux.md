# `whoami` vs `hostname` in Linux

In Linux, `whoami` and `hostname` are two distinct commands that provide different types of information about the system and the user.

## 1. `whoami`
- **Purpose**: Displays the username of the currently logged-in user.
- **Output**: The login name of the user executing the command.
- **Usage**: Useful when you need to verify which user account you are using, especially when switching between different user accounts.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  $ whoami
  john_doe
  ```
## 2. `hostname`

- **Purpose**: Displays the name of the computer (or hostname) as defined by the system.
  
- **Output**: The network name (hostname) of the machine.

- **Usage**: Helpful for identifying the machine on a network, especially when you manage multiple servers or computers.

**Example**:
```bash
$ hostname
ubuntu-pc
```

## Summary of Differences:

- `whoami` identifies **who** the current user is (the username).
- `hostname` identifies the **name** of the system (the machineâ€™s name on the network).

These commands serve different purposes: one is user-specific, and the other is system-specific.
